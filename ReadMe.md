# Discord Bot

I'm working on a discord bot that can have ability to:

- [x] View rules of the discord server
- [ ] Kick members from the server
- [ ] Ban members from the server
- [ ] Give roles to members
- [ ] Retrieve social updates of content creators

To install this python module, Python 3.5.3 or higher is required

To install the library without full voice support, you can just run the following command:

#### For Linux

`python3 -m pip install -U discord.py`

#### For Windows

`py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py`

With voice support

#### For Linux

`python3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]`

#### For Windows

`py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]`
